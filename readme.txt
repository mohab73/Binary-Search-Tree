1- file (ProjectQ2.java) it contains the main method.
2- and also 2 classes "binary_search_tree.java" and "node.java"
when you run the code 
in the console: enter maximum redundancy ratio ,Then enter the values you inseart in the tree.

A brief explanation of the code
Enter the maximum redundancy ratio and the values
